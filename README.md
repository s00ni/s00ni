## Hello! 👋🏼

I'm an IT analyst based in Northern Virginia pivoting into Cloud Engineering. When I'm not staring at a screen, I like to read, sew, and make sure my cat doesn't eat plastic.

## Currently, I am
- 💻 Working on hands-on AWS & Terraform projects  
- 🚀 Learning data structures & algorithms (Python)
